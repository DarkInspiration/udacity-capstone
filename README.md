# Casting Agency App

Full-Stack Developer Nanodegree Program capstone project

## Getting Started

### Installing Dependencies

#### Python 3.7

Follow instructions to install the latest version of python for your platform in the [python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#getting-and-installing-the-latest-version-of-python)

#### Virtual Enviornment

We recommend working within a virtual environment whenever using Python for projects. This keeps your dependencies for each project separate and organaized. Instructions for setting up a virual enviornment for your platform can be found in the [python docs](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)

#### PIP Dependencies

Once you have your virtual environment setup and running, install dependencies by naviging to the `/backend` directory and running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all of the required packages we selected within the `requirements.txt` file.

##### Key Dependencies

- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)  is a lightweight backend microservices framework. Flask is required to handle requests and responses.

- [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) and [Flask-SQLAlchemy](https://flask-sqlalchemy.palletsprojects.com/en/2.x/) are libraries to handle the lightweight sqlite database. Since we want you to focus on auth, we handle the heavy lift for you in `./src/database/models.py`. We recommend skimming this code first so you know how to interface with the Drink model.

- [jose](https://python-jose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) JavaScript Object Signing and Encryption for JWTs. Useful for encoding, decoding, and verifying JWTS.

## Creating DB
Postgress server is needed for database.

```createdb casting_agency```

then run 

```flask db upgrade```

to execute DB upgrades from migration files

## Running the server

To run the server, execute:

```bash
export FLASK_APP=api.py
export FLASK_ENV=debug
flask run --reload
```

App is accessed on:

```
http://0.0.0.0:8080/
```

## Running the tests
Inside ```auth/test_env.py``` you can set JWT tokens for each given role, the tokens will be used to run the tests.

To run the tests, execute:

```bash
python3 test_app.py
```

delete:movie
